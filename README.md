## About the project

- This project is a series of questions to select the best plant for the user to buy.

- The project itself is a ReactJs application where all screened items have been transformed into components, thus aiming at the application scheduling and the best project division for the team.

- Hooks and Sagas were used, thus enabling the application to save user responses, custom search in the company api and submit the form.
